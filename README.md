### Gen 711 Final Project
* I will be working on this project alone *

# Assembly and Identififcation of Mystery Bacteria Genomes 
Goals: 
1. Create a shell script that assembles both bacterial genomes using loops
2. Identify the species
3. Create visualizations of the genomes and phylogeny 

# Background
- The data are in 4 .fastq files, containing the forward and reverse raw 250bp Illumina reads for two different mystery bacteria. 

# Methods
