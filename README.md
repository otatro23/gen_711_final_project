### Gen 711 Final Project
*I will be working on this project alone*

# Assembly and Identififcation of Mystery Bacteria Genomes 
Goals: 
1. Create a shell script that assembles both bacterial genomes using loops
2. Identify the species
3. Create visualizations of the genomes and phylogeny 

# Background
- The data are in 4 .fastq files, containing the forward and reverse raw 250bp Illumina reads for two different mystery bacteria.
- The goal is to use these files to do a de novo genome assembly, annotate the genome, and identify the bacteria species. 

# Methods

# Results
- Species Identification: Both species were _Eschericia coli_.
